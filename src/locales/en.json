  "description": "The developed information and analytical system is designed to monitor changes in carbon dioxide emissions from energy facilities in hard-to-reach territories of the eastern regions of the Russian Federation isolated from energy systems during the implementation of various decarbonization scenarios. The information is presented from the created database of technical, economic and production indicators of power plants and boiler houses that provide energy supply to this category of consumers, and estimates of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere based on the developed mathematical model",
  "footerTitle": "The estimates were obtained during the implementation of the draft state assignment on the topic: FWEU-2021-0004 and research work “Creation of information and analytical support for a module for forecasting the development of the Russian energy sector in terms of the analysis of energy technologies for remote and hard-to-reach areas outside the zone of centralized energy supply” as part of the development of the most important innovative project of national importance “Unified national system for monitoring climate-active substances” (agreement on the provision of grants from the federal budget in the form of subsidies in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 78.1 of the Budget Code of the Russian Federation dated March 1, 2023 No. 139-15-2023-003) (2023-2024 ).
